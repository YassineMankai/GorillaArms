# VR_GorillaArms

This is a project for a course I took at  Télécom Paris. This repository is a cpoy from wenjietseng's "VR-locomotion-parkour" repository. I added an implementation of a locomotion technique inspired by the "Gorilla Tag" game on steam.
 
More details can be found on my [personal blog](https://yassinemankai.netlify.app/). The post is called "IGD301: Lab 4".
